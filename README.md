`kplay` (short for "kafka-playground") lets you inspect messages in a Kafka
topic in a simple and deliberate manner. Using it, you can pull one or more
messages on demand, peruse through them in a list, and, if needed, persist them
to your local filesystem.

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
---

```text
kplay ("kafka playground") lets you inspect messages in a Kafka topic in a simple and deliberate manner.

kplay relies on a configuration file that contains profiles for various Kafka topics, each with its own details related
to brokers, message encoding, authentication, etc.

Usage:
  kplay <PROFILE> [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --config-path string      location of kplay's config file (default "/Users/user/Library/Application Support/kplay/kplay.yml")
  -g, --consumer-group string   consumer group to use (overrides the one in kplay's config file)
      --display-config-only     whether to only display config picked up by kplay
  -h, --help                    help for kplay
  -p, --persist-messages        whether to start the TUI with the setting "persist messages" ON
  -s, --skip-messages           whether to start the TUI with the setting "skip messages" ON
```

üîß Configuration
---

kplay's configuration file looks like the following:

```yaml
profiles:
  - name: json-encoded
    authentication: none
    encodingFormat: json
    brokers:
      - 127.0.0.1:9092
    topic: kplay-test-1
    consumerGroup: kplay-consumer-group-1

  - name: proto-encoded
    authentication: aws_msk_iam
    encodingFormat: protobuf
    protoConfig:
      descriptorSetFile: path/to/descriptor/set/file.pb
      descriptorName: sample.DescriptorName
    brokers:
      - 127.0.0.1:9092
    topic: kplay-test-2
    consumerGroup: kplay-consumer-group-1

  - name: raw
    authentication: none
    encodingFormat: raw
    brokers:
      - 127.0.0.1:9092
    topic: kplay-test-3
    consumerGroup: kplay-consumer-group-1
```

üî§ Message Encoding
---

`kplay` supports parsing messages that are encoded in two data formats: JSON and
protobuf. It also supports parsing raw data (using the `encodingFormat` "raw").

### Parsing protobuf encoded messages

For parsing protobuf encoded messages, `kplay` needs to be provided with a
`FileDescriptorSet` and a descriptor name. Consider a .proto file like the
following:

```text
// application_state.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package sample;

message ApplicationState {
  string id = 1; // required
  string colorTheme = 2;
  string backgroundImageUrl = 3;
  string customDomain = 4;
}
```

A `FileDescriptorSet` can be generated for this file using the [protocol buffer
compiler][5].

```bash
protoc application_state.proto \
    --descriptor_set_out=application_state.pb \
    --include_imports
```

This descriptor set file can then be used in `kplay`'s config file, alongside
the `descriptorName` "sample.ApplicationState".

> Read more about self describing protocol messages [here][3].

üîë Authentication
---

By default, `kplay` operates under the assumption that brokers do not
authenticate requests. Besides this, it supports [AWS IAM authentication][2].

  s                              Toggle skipping mode (if ON, kplay will consume messages,
                                     but not populate its internal list, effectively
                                     skipping over them)
  p                              Toggle persist mode (if ON, kplay will start persisting
                                     messages at the location
                                     messages/<topic>/partition-<partition>/offset-<offset>.txt)
  c                              Toggle commit mode (if OFF, kplay will consume messages without

  ]                              Move to next item in list
```

üîê Verifying release artifacts
---

In case you get the `kplay` binary directly from a [release][4], you may want to
verify its authenticity. Checksums are applied to all released artifacts, and
the resulting checksum file is signed using
[cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/).

Steps to verify (replace `A.B.C` in the commands listed below with the version
you want):

1. Download the following files from the release:

    - kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt
    - kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt.pem
    - kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt.sig

2. Verify the signature:

   ```shell
   cosign verify-blob kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt \
       --certificate kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt.pem \
       --signature kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt.sig \
       --certificate-identity-regexp 'https://github\.com/dhth/kplay/\.github/workflows/.+' \
       --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
   ```

3. Download the compressed archive you want, and validate its checksum:

   ```shell
   curl -sSLO https://github.com/dhth/kplay/releases/download/vA.B.C/kplay_A.B.C_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   sha256sum --ignore-missing -c kplay_A.B.C_checksums.txt
   ```

3. If checksum validation goes through, uncompress the archive:

   ```shell
   tar -xzf kplay_A.B.C_linux_amd64.tar.gz
   ./kplay
   # profit!
   ```
